<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I designed and implemented an electronic air-hockey game on an FPGA device. The game accommodates two players in a 5x5 two-dimensional arena simulated through LEDs and a seven-segment display. The puck's movement on the X and Y axes is represented by sequential illumination of LEDs and displayed on SSD4. Players control their designated sides using left and right buttons. The game begins with an initial turn, displaying the score as "0-0" for two seconds. Players take turns inputting the Y-coordinate and puck direction using sliding switches and buttons. The puck moves at a speed of 1 second per step, and players must hit it within a second to continue the turn. If unsuccessful, the opposing player gains a point. The game concludes when a player scores three goals, displaying the final score, winner, and initiating a celebratory LED blink. This project showcased my proficiency in FPGA programming and embedded system design.
